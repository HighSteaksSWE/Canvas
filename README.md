User Cases:

1] Steve Rogers, client's 5 year old nephew who goes to the ncf daycare, loves computers (can use a computer + ipad), loves drawing, destroys the printer because he doesn't understand how to save pictures

2] Neighbor Loki loves playing PUBG and has a powerful computer (PC bc he hates Macs). Has a mild tremor in his hand because he dropped a 32 pack of water on it last week at Walmart. Loves art and would love to be able to post his art on an online forum. Also wants his grandkids to use the app. Wants to sign his work but has a hard time because of his hand tremor. Also has low vision (reads large print books)

3] Ringling College illustration professor Dr. Strange wants to provide his Animation IV students with a simpler version of Photoshop where they can draw many animation frames quickly. Each student wants to export PNG images frequently because that's the format their animation program likes. Import should also be easy for reference / rotoscoping purposes
Students in the natural sciences want an easy way to draw flowcharts.

4] My cousin's 4 year old daughter Natasha loves playing on her iPad but gets nervous around computers with mice and keyboards. She hasn't yet entered kindergarten so has trouble reading detailed instructions and doing mental math. She loves creating artworks where she uses all the crayons in her box to fill entire pages with color. She wants to be able to email them to her dad stationed in Japan, but my cousin won't let her scan her drawings into the computer because it's hard to clean crayon off the scanner bed. Natasha has resolved to learn how to draw on the computer, but she's worried it will be confusing
